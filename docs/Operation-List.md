## Operations for build facility

These operations are part of a build facility for large project with multiple repos.
You need to pre-setup the folder contained all the repos organized as needed in the build machine.

Concepts

- **Build Spec Project**: A LabVIEW project with build spec in it and named as "_build.[0-9]*.xxxxx.lvproj"
- **Build Index**: The number part in name of **Build Spec Project**.

### `Batch_ListReposBranches` : list all the repos' current branch

    *Not available in LabVIEW 2014,2015*

    Parameters:
        Parameter1. (required) Searching Folder
    Result:
        N/A

### `Batch_SyncReposToLatest` : Sync all repos to latest on the active branch in specified folder

    *Not available in LabVIEW 2014,2015*

    Parameters:
        Parameter1. (required) Searching Folder
    Result:
        N/A

### `Batch_ListBuildSpecProjects` : list all the build spec projects with build order

    *Not available in LabVIEW 2014,2015*

    Notes:
    Smaller **Build Index** means higher priority.
    If no **Build Index** defined in name of **Build Spec Project**, the priority is lowest.
    The build order depends on the name characters. Usually no needs to care about the build orders.
    If you care about the build orders, or dependent relationship exists, add **Build Index** in **Build Spec Project**.

    Parameters:
        Parameter1. (required) Searching Folder
    Result:
        N/A

### `Batch_TriggerBuild` : Start build in specified folder

    Notes:
    Smaller **Build Index** means higher priority.
    If no **Build Index** defined in name of **Build Spec Project**, the priority is lowest.
    The build order depends on the name characters. Usually no needs to care about the build orders.
    If you care about the build orders, or dependent relationship exists, add **Build Index** in **Build Spec Project**.

    Parameters:
        Parameter1. (required) Searching Folder
    Result:
        N/A
